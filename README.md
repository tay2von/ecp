## About this project
The Environmental Control Program is meant to regulate temperature per room within a structure using thermometers in each room to regulate temperature autonomously. Ideally, a building that meets temperature equilibrium will not have “hot” and “cold” areas, but will have evenly adjusted temperatures. Global positioning of homes and buildings, especially those with windows in rooms or offices, can get far too warm or cool, but an initial thermostat reading from one location does not register the change in each area that has ventilation. The ECP will receive temperature data and close vents in order to prevent further heating or cooling based on the temperature of that room. Once the room has met its desired temperature, the ventilation will reopen in that room to allow normal heating and cooling procedures. The thermostat readings will be sub-classes that report to the parent class which is the ventilation control system. The heating/cooling unit itself will not change it’s output, allowing closed vent tubing to cycle that heat or air back toward areas that still have open vents, warming or cooling them in less time, turning off the unit and saving energy costs.
